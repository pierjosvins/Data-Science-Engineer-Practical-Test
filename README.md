# Project Description
In this project, we present our approach to the classification of healthy and diseased trees. To do this, we use the Cherry Disease Detection Dataset, a multi-modal, multi-angular dataset that was created to monitor cherry tree growth, including stress analysis and prediction. The dataset encompasses 577 cherry trees observed throughout a full crop season, spanning from July 2021 to July 2022. First, we processed the data by applying a few transformations.

Next, we construct different unimodal architectures and compare them with each other. For each modality, we select the best architecture in terms of test performance. We then use these to build different multimodal architectures. This project led to the adoption of an API deployment architecture for the best model resulting from our experimentation.

For detailed insights into our findings and methodology, we encourage you to refer to the comprehensive report provided below:
